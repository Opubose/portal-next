# make a new page for this later

`npm run storybook`

# Test

Open the project with `code workspace.code-workspace`.

Under the `@acmutd/acm-ui` workspace, navigate to the `src` folder and create a new folder for your component.

For each component, you will create a (name).css file, a (name).tsx file, a (name).stories.tsx file, and an index.ts file.

The (name).css file will contain all of the styling for your component. Alternatively, you can also style with a CSS-in-JS library, such as Styled-Components.

the (name).tsx file is the compoment's main file.

Storybook uses the (name).stories.tsx file.

INCOMPLETE

# Using your new component
